## Project â€“ phase 22

#### 1.	Personal Coding Standards:
Establish personal coding standards and guidelines for the project. This ensures consistency and readability in your codebase, making it easier for you to manage and maintain.

#### 2.	Version Control:
Implement a version control system to track changes and manage the project's development. This helps you keep a history of your work, experiment with different approaches, and roll back changes if needed.

#### 3.	Initial Codebase:
Create the initial codebase based on the design. Begin with foundational components and gradually build up the functionality according to your project plan. (In this step you can start creating the basic code for your classes based of the diagrams you created in phase 1).
Consider adding classes that contain your exceptions, unit tests, etc.

#### 4.	Testing:
Develop and implement a testing strategy. This includes unit testing and system testing to validate that your code functions as intended and meets the specified requirements.

#### 5.	Peer Review:
As the deadline approaches, we will conduct peer review, this involves reviewing your code for consistency, correctness, and adherence to coding standards. This practice helps identify potential issues early in the development process.

#### 6.	Refactoring:
Periodically review and refactor your codebase to improve its structure, maintainability, and performance. This is an ongoing process to keep your codebase clean and efficient.

#### 7.	Documentation:
Maintain documentation as a form of communication with your future self. Keep design documents and any other relevant documentation up-to-date as your codebase evolves.

#### 8.	Iterative Development:
Embrace an iterative development approach. Implement features incrementally, gather feedback from your own testing, and make adjustments as necessary.

#### 9.	Timeline Management:
Manage your development timeline effectively. Break down tasks into manageable units, set realistic deadlines, and monitor your progress to ensure you meet project goals.

#### 10.	Quality Assurance:
Enforce quality assurance practices throughout development. This includes thorough testing, adherence to personal coding standards, and regular code reviews.

#### NOTE!
The number of classes you need depends on your project, so there's no set amount of classes/lines of code you should create in this phase.

#### Deadline: Please submit phase 2 of this project by the end of class on Thursday (30-11-2023)
